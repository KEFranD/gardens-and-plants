# Garden Website 

Welcome to my Garden Website project! This project is one of my first solo endeavors in building a full-fledged CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) website. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete different gardens. The project is developed using Ruby on Rails for the backend, HTML and CSS for the frontend, and Sass for styling. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¼

Note: This project is inspired by a challenge featured during my time at Le Wagon Bootcamp. It showcases my learning journey and application of the skills acquired during the bootcamp.
## Features

- Create: Users can create new garden entries, providing details like garden name, location, and description.

- Read: Gardens can be viewed by all users. Each garden entry displays its name, location, and a brief description.

- Update: Users can edit the details of existing garden entries, including the name, location, and description.

- Delete: Users have the option to delete garden entries they no longer want to keep in the system.
